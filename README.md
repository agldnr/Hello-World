# Hello-World
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am excited to join CodeYou's August cohort. I do not want to put lots of public information about myself on the internet. However, I do want credit for completing the assignment. I have previously completed the PowerBI analytics course and I'm excited to get into the coding side.
